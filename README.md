# DTA

This is a bachelor thesis on the Diversity trumps Ability debate. The notebook has been created and used to recreate and modify the computational simulation by Hong and Page (2004) (altered subsequently). The notebook also contains the analysis performed in Python. 

There are some deviations from the original model and several extensions. One such extension is the introduction of correlated landscape, which differs from the predominant approach in the literature by averaging adjacent positions repeatedly instead of only choosing certain positions randomly. For further details on the implementation please check out the function documentation provided in the notebook. 

The bachelor thesis can be found here[osf.io/4ypk3] (soon, will include the datasets used in the analysis).
